# Core Concepts

## NYC Open Data

NYC Open Data is free public data published by New York City agencies and other partners.

The Open Data Team at the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI) oversees the program. The team works with City agencies to identify and make data available, coordinate platform operations and improvements, and promote the use of Open Data both within government and throughout NYC. Each City agency also has an Open Data Coordinator, who serves as the main point of contact for the Open Data team and the public, and works to identify, document, structure, and manage the agency’s public datasets.
